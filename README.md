## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Andres, architect/engineer turned developer. My work focuses on data and automation in the built environment. I like to work in Python, JavaScript and Grasshopper, but I'm happy to use whatever tool is most suited for the job at hand. I enjoy learning and teaching, and listening to true crime while I do some work. 

I've recently been down a rabbit hole with cv/dl looking to integrate opencv,  three.js, and mediapipe on the web. And I do some stuff on the side when I have time. I am also interested in geometric rationalization, interoperability workflows, anything related to physics informed neural networks, and how we can build client-first interactive webapps.

- **Automation and Interoperability**: Streamlining workflows with tools like Python, Grasshopper, and Rhino Inside Revit.
- **Interactive Web Development**: Building user-focused platforms using Vue.js, Three.js, and D3.js.
- **Geometric Rationalization**: Exploring computational techniques for structural and facade optimization.
- **Machine Learning and Physics**: Applying NVIDIA Modulus and PINNs to tackle fluid dynamics and urban modeling challenges.
